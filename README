This library contains three parts: logics, a logic generator and Hoare logics.

============================================

Logics.

You can find basic logic settings, propositional logics and separation logics
in the following folders:
    GeneralLogic
    MinimumLogic
    PropositionalLogic
    SeparationLogic
You can find formalized proof theories, semantic definitions, soundness
proofs and completeness proofs. The library is built-up in an extensible
style, using Coq's typeclasses and higher-order features. But at the same
time, we also provide several concrete examples, containing both shallow
embeddings and deep embeddings.

============================================

Logic Generator.

The folder "LogicGenerator" contains our development about this
generator. It requires users to provide a configuration file. Then a command
line can be used to generate an interface file:
    ./logic_gen CONFIGURATION_FILE INTERFACE_FILE
The configuration file should specify involved connectives and primary proof
rules. The interface file will contain a Module Type (where these connectives
and proof rules are specified) and a Module functor which generate many many
derived rules from primary ones. See LogicGenerator/demo for more information.

============================================

Hoare Logics.

This part is not quite complete. It contains some elementary results about Hoare
logic soundness, especially those about concurrent separation logic.

============================================

Dependency: Coq 8.10

============================================

How to install.

Run "make" or "make -j7" for parallel in your command line. A CONFIGURE file
may be needed for setting up COQBIN.

============================================

Open Source.

This library is NOT open sourced for now.
