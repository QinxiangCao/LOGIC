Demo 1:
  With instance parameter.
  Full intuintionistic propositional logic.
  Defining primary rules using "provable", i.e. " |-- P "
  Deriving " Phi |-- P " from " |-- P ".
  Implementation using shallow embedding.

Demo 2:
  A very small language and logic (only connective is "implication").
  Defining primary rules using "provable", i.e. " |-- P "
  Implementation using both deep embedding and shallow embedding.

Demo 3:
  Full intuintionistic propositional logic.
  Defining primary rules using "derivable", i.e. " Phi |-- P "
  Deriving " |-- P " from " Phi |-- P ".
  Implementation using shallow embedding.

Demo 4:
  Intuintionistic separation logic logic (without wand)
  Defining primary rules using "provable", i.e. " |-- P "
  Implementation using shallow embedding.

Demo 5:
  Intuintionistic separation logic logic (with wand)
  Defining primary rules using "provable", i.e. " |-- P "
  Implementation using shallow embedding.

Demo 6:
  Classic separation logic logic (without wand)
  Defining primary rules using "provable", i.e. " |-- P "
  Implementation using shallow embedding.
